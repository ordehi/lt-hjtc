// Try it out yourself, run this line of code in your browser Console and then try sending anything using the `hj()` function, it can be an Event as you might have seen such as `hj('event', 'my_wondeful_event')` or a flerbo `hj('flerbo', 'bleepbloop')` or even an emoji `hj('ðŸ¥“', 'tasty')` Unfortunately, sending bacon to Hotjar, or anything not in our APIs, won't do anything once Hotjar is loaded, the command would just be rejected, but it's a cool way to start understanding how Hotjar works under the hood.
